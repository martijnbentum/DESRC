# Dutch EEG Speech Register Corpus

The Dutch EEG Speech Register Corpus contains 207 hours of EEG recordings from 48 participants listening to 
natural connected speech. The speech recordings were sampled from spontaneous dialogues, news broadcasts 
and read-aloud stories, and contain 50,277 word tokens per participant, time-locked to the EEG recordings

### Loading data

Clone the repository and update the directories in locations.py
The corpus directory is important to update to be able to update.
Updating cgn_audio and ifadv_audio is optional.

```python
#change this to the directory of the corpus
corpus_dir= ''
#change this to the directory of the CGN audio files:
cgn_audio= ''
#change this to the directory of the IFADV audio files:
ifadv_audio = ''
```

```python
import read_xml
import load_eeg

# Loading metadata for 1 participant
p1 = load_participant(pp_id = 1, add_words = True)
```

This loads the metadata available for a participant. If add_words is true, the information for all words in the speech materials is loaded (this can take some time).

the participant object contains _sessions_ (recording sessions during which participant listened to a specific speech register (e.g. spontanuous dialogues), _blocks_ a continuous stretch of EEG recording during which participants listened to speech. _words_ a list of word object, each word object contains information linking the audio to the eeg and general word information. A _session_, _block_ and _word_ object contain the method _explanation()_ with information for all fields contained by the object

```python
# load the EEG data for 1 participant
# Filters the EEG data with a Butterworth bandpass filter (0.05 - 30 Hz) and applies ICA decomposition to remove eye blinks

load_eeg.load_word_epochs_participant(p1, unload_eeg = False)
```

The EEG data is loaded for each block. If unload_eeg data = False, the data for a _block_ can be found under _data_ attribute in the _block_ object. The data is also present as an MNE object under the _raw_ attribute also attached to the _block_ object. The _data_ numpy matrix only contains data from good electrodes. The list of electrodes can be found under _ch_, the rejected channels can be found under _reject_channels_.

```python
# get the first block
b = p1.blocks[0]
b.data # numpy matrix channels X sample
b.ch # list of channel names - index corresponds with the index of data
b.rejected_channels # list of channels that were rejected 

b.raw # mne object containing the same EEG data
b.explanation() # show information about all fields of a block

```

The whole section of EEG data precisely corresponds to the speech materials played during the block.

```python
b.wav_filename # the audio filename played during this block
b.words # contains a list of words in the speech materials with information to link it to the EEG and audio
w = b.words[0]
w.st # start time in seconds
w.st_sample # start index in b.data
w.explanation() # show information about all fields of a word
```


The data is annotated for artefacts. The start and index for artefacts are listed under _artefact_st_ (artefact start time) and _artefact_et_ (artefact end time). These indices can be used to slice out EEG materials with artefact from the _data_ numpy matrix.

```python
index = b.artefact_st[0] # start index of the artefact
first_clean_section = b.data[:,:index] # select the first stretch of clean EEG data from the block
```

The data is also epoched into word epochs. The epochs can be found under _extracted_eeg_words_ which is a list of numpy matrices. The epoch start 300 ms before word onset and ends 1000ms after word onset. The channel set for each word is identical for a given block, but can differ between blocks (because different electrodes could be faulty in different blocks). The channels listed in b.ch correspond to the rows in the matrix. With _extracted_word_indeces_ you can find the word that corresponds to the eeg data.

```python
epoch = b.extracted_eeg_words[0]
index = b.extracted_word_indices[0]
word = b.words[index]
```
